   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>Let's prepare the shortcrust pastry: mix the eggs, sugar and oil with a spoon in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>When we obtain a homogeneous mixture, we add the flour and the baking powder, continuing to mix in the bowl until we obtain a workable dough.
        <li>Let's move onto the work surface and knead by hand with the help of a handful of flour.
        <li>Once the dough is smooth, wrap it in cling film and put it in the fridge for at least half an hour.
        <li>For the filling, first beat the egg whites until stiff with an electric whisk.
        <li>Add the sugar to the egg whites and continue mixing with the whisk.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the toasted hazelnuts using a food processor, then add them to the filling together with the grated lemon peel and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Once the resting time has elapsed, we take the pastry and roll it out using flour and a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>We roll the dough in the rolling pin and place it in a 24 cm diameter tart pan, buttered and floured.</li>
        <li>Carefully line the pan with the pastry, then remove the excess edges using the back of a knife.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the pastry shell and level it with the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>We decorate the surface with chopped hazelnuts and bake in a preheated oven for about 30 minutes, at 170 °C if it is fan-assisted or at 190 °C if it is static.</li>
        <li>Let's take our hazelnut tart out of the oven and serve it!</li>
    </ol>
