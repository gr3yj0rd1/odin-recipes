   <p>Rosemary focaccia is an easy and tasty recipe, ideal as an appetizer or for a day trip.</p>
   
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>400g flour</li>
    <li>7g fresh yeast</li>
    <li>140g potatoes</li>
    <li>180ml fresh water (30 ml for the brine)</li>
    <li>10g sugar</li>
    <li>6g salt</li>
    <li>pepper</li>
    <li>rosemary</li>
    <li>70g olive oil (50 for the dough + 20 for the brine)</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>We put all the dough ingredients except the salt in a large bowl. Then we pour in: the flour, water, oil, sugar, mashed boiled potato and the sachet of PANEANGELI Mastro Fornaio Brewer's Yeast. We work all the ingredients with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Once you have formed an irregular dough, transfer it to a pastry board and add the salt, then work it by hand for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once you have obtained a smooth and homogeneous dough, transfer it to a bowl, make the classic cross cut, cover with cling film and leave to rise for 2 hours or until doubled in volume.</li>
        <li>We spread the dough with our hands directly in a baking pan (mine measures 30 cm x 40 cm) lightly greased with oil. Let the focaccia rise in the pan for another half hour.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, prepare the brine that will season the focaccia. Mix the water, oil, chopped rosemary and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>After the second rising time, press the focaccia with your fingertips to form many small dimples and sprinkle it with the brine using a brush. Sprinkle the focaccia with a pinch of coarse salt and bake in a static oven preheated to 200 Â°C for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Here is the rosemary focaccia served on the table! I recommend you eat it very hot, but even cold the next day it is really delicious!</li>
